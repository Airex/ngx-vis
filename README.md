# ng2-vis
An angular 2 vis.js project (in a very early development stage)

## Demo
Currently I've added only the basic example for a vis.js network:
* [Demo Page](https://seveves.github.io/ng2-vis)

## Work in progress:
At the moment there is only the network component wrapper (service and directive).
I am trying to add the other components as soon as possible in the following order:
* Graph2D
* Timeline
* DataSet
* Graph3D

Contributions of any kind are very welcome!

### Network
* adding more example for the network component
* writing unit tests for the network component

### Misc
* getting travis to work
* publish to npm
* adding some cool badges to this README

## Credits
* thanks to [MichaelBitard](https://github.com/agileek/typings-vis) for initiating the vis.js type definitions.
* thanks to [valor-software](https://github.com/valor-software) for their nice examples on how to setup, build and publish a angular2 module.
