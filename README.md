## Demo
Currently I've added only the basic example for a vis.js network:
* [Demo Page](https://seveves.github.io/ng2-vis)

## Work in progress:
At the moment there is only the network component wrapper (service and directive).
I am trying to add the other components as soon as possible in the following order:
* Graph2D
* Timeline
* DataSet
* Graph3D

Contributions of any kind are very welcome!

### Network
* adding more examples for the network component
* ~~writing unit tests for the network component~~

### Misc
* testing npm package
* writing more unit tests
* ~~getting travis to work~~
* ~~publish to npm~~
* ~~adding some cool badges to this README~~
